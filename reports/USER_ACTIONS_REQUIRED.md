# USER ACTIONS REQUIRED (Ian)

Snapshot: 2026-10-28, about 14:25 EDT. Automation never merges into `main`, never closes PRs and never deploys. Everything below needs a human. See `FINAL_REPORT.md` §2 for the merge policy (gates G1–G9) and the status of each PR.

## Merge policy (recorded)
- A PR merges only when G1–G7 pass for its **exact head SHA**:
  - G1: a human reviewed that SHA
  - G2: exceptions are adjudicated
  - G3: checks pass
  - G4: docs match the code
  - G5: integration-tested
  - G6: revalidated against current `main`
  - G7: verified on `main` after the merge
- G8 (no false-pass tests) and G9 (no superseded unsafe code) must also hold.
- A passing scanner alone never meets a gate.
- Proposed order: #7, after its blockers are fixed. Then close #1 as superseded and close #2–#5 as landed through #7. Every other PR lands on its own.

## A. Decisions, verifications and approvals
| ID | Action | Where |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | **Finish the remaining exception verifications.** EX-01..EX-04 are DECIDED (see the register below), but four checks are still open:<br>• **EX-01:** verify the AccessLogsBucket policy (TLS-only deny, PutObject only from `logging.s3.amazonaws.com` with SourceArn = DataBucket and SourceAccount), then sign off.<br>• **EX-02:** have #5's `SECURITY_EXCEPTIONS.md` reworded as an explicit lab limitation. Remove the "not expressible in an env-agnostic stack" rationale and note that the exception covers 2 resources.<br>• **EX-03:** verify the exact wildcard scope (`…:log-group:RDSOSMetrics:log-stream:*`, 4 log actions, this account and region; trust `monitoring.rds.amazonaws.com` + `aws:SourceAccount`), then accept or reject.<br>• **EX-04:** review the Backup role. Its trust lacks `aws:SourceAccount`; the vault has no access policy or Vault Lock and shares the DB CMK. Then accept or reject.<br>Afterwards, record the decisions in #5 (register status plus approver) so that B5-1 is closed | [#5](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/5) `evidence/aws/aws-remediation-vpc-rds/SECURITY_EXCEPTIONS.md` |
| A2 | **Fix B5-2 (KMS key-admin escalation) before #5 or #7 can merge:**<br>• use a named key-admin principal<br>• drop `kms:CreateGrant` from the admin actions, or add `kms:GrantIsForAWSResource`<br>• restrict `kms:PutKeyPolicy`<br>• add a negative test<br>• withdraw the "least-privilege CMK" claim until it is fixed<br>Correct #7's AC5 ("MET") as well | [#5](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/5), [#7](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/7), [#14](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/14) |
| A3 | **Confirm the Entra CA baseline choices:** risk policies stay report-only, device compliance applies to All users on All apps, and the list of 12 privileged roles | [#4](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/4) |
| A4 | **Do a human GitHub review of each exact head SHA** (G1). No PR has one. #14's notes (#3 approve, #4 approve with comments, #5 and #6 request changes) are agent review notes, not a sign-off | all PRs |
| A5 | **Close #1 as superseded by #5** once #7 lands | [#1](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/1) |
| A6 | **Send #6 back for changes:**<br>• B6-1: self-logging on `TrailAccessLogsBucket`<br>• B6-2: SCP exempt-role-name bypass<br>• B6-3: decide whether to accept CDK or redo it in **Terraform**, as your plan asked<br>• also adjudicate its 2 parliament allowlist entries | [#6](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/6) |
| A7 | **Review the docs and simulation PRs:**<br>• #8: links verified, prose not checked<br>• #9: SIMULATION wording<br>• #10: tests and evidence verified, code not reviewed<br>• #12: job matrix<br>• #13: synthetic team model | [#8](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/8), [#9](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/9), [#10](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/10), [#12](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/12), [#13](https://github.com/onnxscibroccoli/bank-it-operations-lab/pull/13) |
| A8 | **Decide on Backup/DR:** finish and push it, or drop it. No PR exists; the work is uncommitted in `/workspace/bkp-dr-aws-worker` | box |
| A9 | **Accept or ticket the known gaps:**<br>• Actions pinned by tag, not SHA<br>• no CI on #6, #8–#10, #12 or #13<br>• the cdk-nag 2.x pin<br>• no lifecycle or retention rules on the #5 buckets<br>• the allowlist test misses stack-level suppressions | — |
| A10 | **Post-merge (G7):** after each merge, re-run CI and evidence verification on `main`, and revert if anything fails | — |

## B. Credentials, secrets and access (only if you want more than static evidence)
| ID | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | **Choose an AWS sandbox role with OIDC (no long-lived keys)** for a real deploy, Access Analyzer checks of the #6 SCPs, or live checks of the exceptions | Nothing exists today. Do not add AWS keys as repo secrets |
| B2 | **Choose a sandbox Entra tenant** for checking #4 against real tenant state | #4 is offline and synthetic only today |
| B3 | **Set up a dedicated rclone Google client_id** for Drive evidence checkpoints | The shared client_id is being retired [#1 MORNING_REPORT] |
| B4 | **Turn on branch protection for `main`:** require a review plus the checks `aws-cdk`, `offline-validation` and `postgres-restore-evidence` | Repo admin setting; not done |

## Security exception register: EX-01..EX-04 (#5), DECIDED
Source: the ChatGPT security review as adopted by Ian, relayed 2026-10-28 at about 14:10 EDT. It is not yet recorded in #5.

| ID | cdk-nag rule | Resource | Decision | Open condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EX-01 | NIST.800.53.R5-S3DefaultEncryptionKMS | BankItLabSecureStorage/AccessLogsBucket | **ACCEPTED for the lab** | Bucket-policy verification (A1) |
| EX-02 | NIST.800.53.R5-S3BucketReplicationEnabled | AccessLogsBucket, DataBucket | **ACCEPTED as an explicit limitation.** The "env-agnostic makes it impossible" claim is **REJECTED** | Reword the register (A1) |
| EX-03 | AwsSolutions-IAM5 (`log-group:RDSOSMetrics:log-stream:*`) | BankItLabNetworkDatabase/RdsMonitoringPolicy | **OPEN** | Verify the exact wildcard scope (A1) |
| EX-04 | AwsSolutions-IAM4 (AWSBackupServiceRolePolicyForBackup) | BankItLabNetworkDatabase/BackupPlan/Postgres/Role | **CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE** | Role review (A1) |
